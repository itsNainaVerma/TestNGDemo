-->So what exactly is dependency testing? 
Dependency testing is when two or more actions, two or more tasks, or two or more functions depend on the order of their methods. For example, we must sign into the application before we can sign out of the application. Therefore, signing out depends on us first signing in. If we, reverse that order and execute, then the sign out method would fail.

-->Below Attributes are used to assist annotations with our dependency testing. All three of these attributes can be placed in the configuration and test annotations:
1. dependsOn
2. groups
3. dependsOnGroups


--> The dependsOnMethods attribute is used to specify that a test method depends on the successful execution of one or more other test methods. 
If the dependent method fails, the current test will be skipped.

--> The groups attribute allows you to organize and categorize test methods into groups. This can be helpful for running specific sets of tests based on their group or to include/exclude certain groups from execution.

-->  the dependsOnGroups attribute allows you to specify that a test method should depend on the successful execution of tests in specific groups. If any test in the specified group fails, the dependent test will be skipped.
